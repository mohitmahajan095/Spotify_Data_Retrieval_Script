# Spotify Data Retrieval Script
**Spotify Data Retrieval Script:** A Python script that uses Spotipy to interact with the Spotify Web API and retrieve a user's saved tracks, playlists, and recently played tracks. Outputs to console. Great starting point for working with the Spotify API.

# Installation                     
To use this script, you will need to install the Spotipy library. You can do this using pip:

**pip install spotipy**

# Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Enter your Spotify client ID, client secret, and redirect URI when prompted.
3. Run the script using the command :
   
   **python spotify_data_retrieval.py**

The script will then retrieve the user's saved tracks, playlists, and recently played tracks, and print them out to the console.
